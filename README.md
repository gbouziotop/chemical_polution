# Pollution sources in the northern west Black Sea shelf

This project investigates the pollution source in the northern west Black Sea shelf. Data were generated by a non-target screening workflow [1]. The unknown chemical signals (a.k.a components) were visualized in figures. 652 figures were manually annotated as chemicals coming from the Danube, 559 figures were annotated as chemicals coming from the Dnieper river and 195 were labeled as substances with unknown source origin (http://dsfp.chem.uoa.gr/BlackSea/train/).

The labeled figures were used to train a neural network classifier with the aim to create a model to predict the sources of chemicals in this region of Black Sea (prediction of 10,026 unknown chemical signals).
